WE CANNOT USE VECOTR, ARRAYS, FOR HIERCHIAL PURPOSE
TREE IS A NON LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE, 
AT THE TOP OF THE HIERCHIAL IS ROOT NODE,
AND THE NODES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HIERICHARY IS CALLED LEAF NODES
NODES BELOW THE NODES ARE CALLED IS CHILD NODE,
PARENT IS ABOVE THE NODE IS CALLED PARENT

TREE data strucutre is recursive in nature.
trees contian trees inside the tree called subtrees
descendant of the tree is are the roots that lie in the subtrees 
of the root.

degree of a node - number of childern it has.
leaf nodes have degree with 0
internal nodes, the leafs that dont have degree 0 is called internal
nodes.


APPLICATION OF TREE DATASTRUCUTRE:
-> to represent hierarchial data
    -> organization strucutre
    -> folder strucutre
    -> xml/html content (JSON objects)
    -> In OOP (Inhertiance)
-> Binary search tree
-> Binary heap (mainly used to represent priorties ques), and this
is used in disjkarta algorithm and huffman algorithm., prims algorithm
-> B aur B+ trees in dbms
-> in computer networks spanning and shortest path
-> parse tree and expression tree in compilers.


variations of trees
-> Trie (is used to represent dictonaries, it also supports operations like
    prefix search)
-> Suffix tree (used fast seraches in a tree, you have a pattern and a big text
    )
-> binary indexed tree -> searches in a range.
-> segment tree -> searches in a range.


BINARY TREE
Every node has at-most two childern
 left child pointer ->   |    |  30   |    | <- right child pointer
                           /              \
                  |    |  40   | null |  |  | 50  |    |            
for leafs 
There is array represntation of trees, such as binary heaps
But binary trees are
