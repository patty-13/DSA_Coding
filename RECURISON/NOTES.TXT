RECURSION IS BASICALLY CALLING THE FUNCTION ITSELF
1. HELPFUL in dfs, bfs if using without any 
TAIL RECURSION:
if all the statements are being invoked before the function call 
itsself then its called a tail recursion.

so tail recursion is better than the non tail recursion as it 
can be optimized by the compiler. 
As the recurison function is in the last so the compiler doesnt 
save the recursive stack.

-> so to make a non-tail recursive argument into recursive 
argument just make a new argument and store its value in it.
